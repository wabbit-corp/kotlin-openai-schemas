## Generated Facts

- Workspace config source of truth: `root.clj` at the workspace root.

- Setup-managed files are regenerated with `dev setup kotlin-openai-schemas`; avoid hand-editing stamped generated files.
- Sanctioned override files in this repo: `build.extra.gradle.kts`, `settings.local.gradle.kts`.
- Review `kotlin-conventions.md` before editing Kotlin code in this repo.
